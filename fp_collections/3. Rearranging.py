Write a function `rearrange(l)', ' that, given a list of numbers `l', ',
rearranges it so that all non-positive numbers appear before the positive
ones, but does **not** alter the numbersâ€™ relative order (i.e., all positive
numbers must appear in the same order relative to each other as in the
original list; same goes for non-positive numbers).
